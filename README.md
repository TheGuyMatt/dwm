# Matthew's dwm build
My build of the [suckless](https://dwm.suckless.org) dynamic window manager

## Requirements
You must have my fonts installed from [my dotfiles](https://github.com/TheGuyMatt/dotfiles). 
This build of dwm only uses the default colors and does not use Xresources or pywal.

## Patches/Features
* Reads from `pywal`
* Urgent Borders
* Actual fullscreen with `super+shift+f`
* Swallow patch: programs that make terminal inoperable take the terminal's place
* vanitygaps: gaps for all layouts + smart gaps
