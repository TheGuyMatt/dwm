# Matthew's dwm build
My build of the [suckless](https://dwm.suckless.org) dynamic window manager

## Requirements
* You must install pywal and run it at least once for this config to work! The Arch package is `python-pywal`
* Install `alacritty` or change config to use the `st` terminal

## Patches/Features
* Reads from `pywal`
* Urgent Borders
* Actual fullscreen with `super+f`
* Full gaps patch
* Swallow patch: programs that make terminal inoperable take the terminal's place
